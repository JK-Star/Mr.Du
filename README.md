This is a small parallel programming experience for testing what the author has learned in the parallel program designing.

There are mainly three topics which includes the calculation of pi、the test of SPECOMP2012 and the calculation of matrix.

For the first topic, we try to get the specific value as accurate as possible. Besides, it's also our goal to speed up the
program with specific machine includeing AVX-float、AVX-double、SSE-float、SSE-double、serial and openmp versions.

As to the second, just test the SPECOMP2012 with different threads or setting the environment at dynamic ,static or guided.


The last, may be the most familiar to us.The versions includes tranpose、blocked、openmp+tranpose and MPI.
