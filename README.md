++This first topic is about calculating pi++
  pi.c  includes AVX-float、AVX-double、SSE-float、SSE-double、serial、openmp six versions


++This second topic is about testing the SPECOMP2012++
  run this standard test program using different threads or setting the environment at dynamic guided or static  


++This third topic is about optimizing the calculation of matrix, whose scale is not big, other user can adjust it by yourself++
